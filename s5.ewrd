Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. \n\nNow Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.","shortsummary":"Nolan at his most intelligent best.","note":"Don't edit the sample directly, the update of samples may cause loss of your book!","sort":0,"iscurrent":true,"bid":"970ef321-a226-5597-d4b0-3b2ce3669620","updateDes":"7  scene","versionchecked":true,"coverauthor":"Christopher Nolan","coversource":"Reference only","showall":-1},"topics":[{"title":"INCEPTION","type":"root","sort":1,"isCurrent":0,"bid":"970ef321-a226-5597-d4b0-3b2ce3669620","created":1456653671383,"updated":1456653671383,"summary":"","number":1,"body":"","parentid":"","expand":true,"id":"744b6050-1990-b0c8-302f-1607857599f5"},{"title":"Introduction","parentid":"744b6050-1990-b0c8-302f-1607857599f5","type":"manage","sort":1,"bid":"970ef321-a226-5597-d4b0-3b2ce3669620","created":1456654118946,"updated":1456654118946,"summary":"","number":1,"body":"","expand":true,"id":"7687d49d-1bad-726b-5c65-f67761bf2377","length":12,"isCurrent":0},{"title":"EXT.
